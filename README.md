# polimorph-operator
polimorph-operator is a Kubernetes operator designed to perform DNS lookups on Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDN) and subsequently update NetworkPolicies with the resulting CIDRs. This is especially useful for environments where IP addresses associated with domain names can change frequently, and there's a need to ensure that NetworkPolicies are always up-to-date.

## Features
- Dynamic DNS Lookups: Continuously resolves FQDNs to ensure the most recent CIDRs are available.
- NetworkPolicy Integration: Automatically updates the Kubernetes NetworkPolicies with the CIDRs obtained from the DNS lookups.
- Custom Resource (CR) Support: Uses a custom resource named PoliMorphPolicy to specify which FQDNs need to be resolved and which NetworkPolicies should be updated.

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster
1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/polimorph-operator:tag
```

3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/polimorph-operator:tag
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Contributing
We welcome contributions to the polimorph-operator! Please see the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details.

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/).

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/),
which provide a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the cluster.

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
